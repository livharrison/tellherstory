            <p>According to current data, less than 30% of the world's researchers are female. This doesn't mean that women haven't made an incredible impact on our understanding of science - and will continue to do so for years to come! History is full of women who have made enormous contributions to many fields, from biology to physics, chemistry to computer science, mathematics to engineering.</p>
            <p>For example, did you know that Hedy Lamarr, a famous actress from the 20th century, actually invented the technology that was the precursor to modern-day WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth?</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, female contributions to science have often been overlooked. As we spread awareness of female groundbreakers in the STEM field, we can ensure women a seat at the science table for years to come.</p>

                <p>Ada was the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron. She studied lots of math and logic as a child, and eventually worked with Charles Babbage on his prototype of a computer, called an Analytical Engine. Ada helped to build the Anayltical Engine, and she is credited with foundational work in the field of computer science - she is often referred to as the first computer programmer!</p>

                <p>Rachel Carson was an American natural biologist. Her book 'Silent Spring' warned the public about the risks of polluting the environment. She spoke up against the use of DDT, a harmful pesticide being used in the 60's and 70's. Her writings about the environment still influence us today.</p>

                <p>Born in Nanjing, China - later moved to California, USA</p>
                <p>Chien-Shiung attended National Central University in China to obtain her undergraduate degree in physics, and then received her PhD in physics in 1940 at the University of California, Berkeley. She was denied a scholarship during her graduate studies on the basis of race. She taught at Smith College, Princeton University, and Columbia University. She was the first female faculty of Princeton's physics department!</p>
                <p>While at Columbia, she contributed to the Manhattan Project, which was critical for the development of nuclear technology that we use today in power generators and medical imaging scans. Wu conducted research that disproved a principle of physics, known as the conservation of parity of beta particles. Physics researchers had held this principle as fact for decades. Two male scientists, Lee and Yang, received the Nobel Prize for this discovery, although Wu's research was at the heart of the project.</p>
                <p>Despite missing out on the Nobel Prize that was rightfully hers, Chien-Shiung did garner several other accolades throughout her life, including the Comstock Prize in Physics, being the first female president of the American Physical Society, and even had an asteroid named after her! She is one of the most important names in physics.</p>

                <p>Polish-born, spent most of her life in France</p>
                <p>Marie is best known for being the first female to be awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics. Later, she won a Nobel in Chemistry as well, making her the first person to receive two Nobel Prizes! Marie discovered radioactivity, and also headed the development of X-rays. She became the world' foremost authority on radium, which is an elemnt she discovered. Alongside her husband Pierre, she also discovered the element polonium.</p>
                <p>Marie had a daughter, Irene Joliot-Curie, who was also a celebrated physicist. She led radiology units in WWI and worked alongside her mother in the lab as Marie's assistant. Irene won a Noble Prize for her discovery of artificial radioactivity.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, years spent in close proximity to radioactive materials took a serious toll on Marie's health. The cause of her death is believed to be due to exposure to radiation. Her work lives on, and is fundamental to our understanding of physics & radioactivity today.</p>
