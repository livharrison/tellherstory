            <p>The very first arguments for women's rights were made in the political sphere when women realized that they could not change anything without political power. The earliest women's suffrage movements were in the 1840's, with the Seneca Falls Convention. Women gathered and drafted a "Declaration of Sentiments", listing grievances and requests of the female sex. The signers of this document did not see the results during their lifetime, but the convention and spirits of these women helped ratify the 19th amendment, giving women the vote over 5 decades later.</p>
            <p>With the first female vice president, there have been major advancements in women's role in politics. Without the work of these early women, we would not have equal voting rights and opportunities in the political sphere.</p>

                <p>Lucretia was an early advocate of feminism and abolition. She spent her life speaking out about these issues in pursuit of justice. She and her husband joined William Lloyd Garrison's American Anti-Slavery Society in the 1830s. Lucretia was often put down for speaking up, as it was not socially acceptable at this time for women to be active in public speaking.</p>
                <p>Lucretia met Elizabeth Cady Stanton at an anti-slavery convention in London. They went on to organize the Seneca Falls Convention together, a turning point in the fight for female suffrage. She was also invovled with the establishment of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, and helped make sure the college was coeducational.</p>

                <p>Ida B. Wells was a social reformer, activist, journalist, and feminist. She spent a lot of her time and energy fighting for African American rights. She was born enslaved in Mississippi, but was freed with the passing of the Emancipation Proclamation when she was about six months old. When Ida was about 22 and living in Nashville, she bought a first-class train ticket, but was told to move to the car for African American passengers. This enraged her, and she sued the railroad. This event also inspired her to write.</p>
                <p>Working as a journalist, she wrote articles against lynching and other injust killings of Black individuals happening in her area. She traveled the American South for two months to gather more information about lynchings. She went on to lead a protest in Washington, D.C., urging then-President McKinley to do something about the problem. Ida also fought for womens' suffrage, co-founded the NAACP, and created the first African American kindergarten in her community.</p>
